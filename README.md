# Chat App â€“ Flutter & Custom Backend

### This project is a chat application built for learning and self-improvement.
### I had already created a social backend system, so it was a natural step to develop a Flutter-based client app for it. During the development, I had the chance to deepen my knowledge of Flutter, backend communication, and real-time messaging.

## **Key Features**

* User authentication and error handling on login page

* Sending and receiving messages in real time

* Managing topics and chat rooms

* (Planned) push notifications, user settings

## **Technology**

* Flutter frontend

* Custom C# social backend (SignalR, REST API, database)

* Real-time communication via SignalR

* Infinite scroll, form validation, state management

## Why?

Simple: I started it â€” and I finished it. ðŸ˜„
The main goal was to learn through a real project, not just tutorials, and this chat app became my tool for that.
